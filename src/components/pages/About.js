      <p>
        I am a recent graduate from the University of Houston with a BS in Biology. 
        In August of 2023, I completed a Full Stack Web Development course from Rice
        University's Glassock School of Continuing Education.

        Currently, I am looking for a role in an entry level front end or back end 
        web development position.
