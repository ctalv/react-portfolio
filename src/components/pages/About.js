        My passion has always been science. From a young age, I spent all my time outside
        exploring the natural world. As I grew older, I began developing an interest in
        video games and learning about computers. It was not until I took a college course
        in the MATLAB coding language that I realized coding is my thing.

        I am a recent graduate from the University of Houston with a BS in Biology.
        In August of 2023, I completed a Full Stack Web Development course from Rice
        University's Glassock School of Continuing Education.

        Currently, I am looking for a role in an entry level front end or back end
        web development position.
